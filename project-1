Project Overview
Objective: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy a web application using Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Jenkins.

Steps Involved
Version Control with Git:
Use Git for source code management. Create a repository on GitHub or GitLab to store your application code.
Continuous Integration with Jenkins:
Set up Jenkins to automate the build process. Configure Jenkins to pull the latest code from the Git repository whenever changes are pushed.
Create a Jenkins pipeline to build the application and run tests.

Containerization with Docker:
Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application. This Dockerfile will define the environment in which your application runs.
Build a Docker image using Jenkins and push it to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

Configuration Management with Ansible:
Use Ansible to manage the configuration of your servers. Write Ansible playbooks to install necessary dependencies and configure the environment.
Ansible can also be used to deploy the Docker container to the server.

Orchestration with Kubernetes:
Set up a Kubernetes cluster to manage your containerized application. Use Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) to define the deployment, services, and other resources.

Deploy the Docker container to the Kubernetes cluster using Jenkins.

Example Workflow
Code Commit: Developer commits code to the Git repository.
Build Trigger: Jenkins detects the commit and triggers a build.
Build and Test: Jenkins builds the application, runs tests, and creates a Docker image.
Push Image: Jenkins pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry.
Deploy with Ansible: Ansible playbooks are run to prepare the environment.
Deploy to Kubernetes: Jenkins deploys the Docker container to the Kubernetes cluster.
